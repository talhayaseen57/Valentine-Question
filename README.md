# Valentine-Question

Welcome to Valentine-Question! This is a single-page webpage developed with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The purpose of this page is to playfully convince someone to be your Valentine.

## How it Works

The webpage starts by asking a simple question: "Will you be my Valentine?". If the answer is "NO", the question keeps changing dynamically to persuade the opponent to reconsider. The sequence of questions includes:

- "Are you sure?"
- "Are you really sure??"
- "Are you really really sure???"
- "Think again?"
- etc.....

Each time the opponent selects the "NO" button, the size of the "YES" button keeps growing dynamically.

If the opponent chooses the "YES" button, a message "OOOO!!! Love You Soo Much ❤️ Yaaaaa" along with kissing animations is displayed.
